# HC-Mod

Most "newer" changes have been done using the xml files - exept for files which are comletly new...
Old changes were done by direct ini modding
xml files with name client* only change Clientside mod files - server* --> serverside
xml files with name both* are identical between client and server mod

Clientmod includes flhook - use Freelancer 1.0 no patches!
 
Servermod doesn't include flhook - use Flhook from Starport and Freelancer patch 1.1

Testmod changes spawn point to Neutral Zone and adds everything you need to test modchanges (Money, Equipment, ...)
